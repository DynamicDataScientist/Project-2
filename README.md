# Project-2
Retail Marketing Analysis using Python | Tableau
### Problem Statement:
- It is a critical requirement for business to understand the value derived from a customer. RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value.
- Customer segmentation is the practice of segregating the customer base into groups of individuals based on some common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits
- Perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value).

I worked on this capstone project towards completion of final assessment for PGP in Data Science course from Access Million. My job was to analyze transactional data for a online retail company and create customer segementation so that company can create effective marketing campaign. I performed following tasks in this project:-
- Data Cleaning
- Data Transformation
- Data Modeling - RFM (Recency Frequency Monetary) model
- Data Modeling - K-means clustering algorithm
- Data Reporting - Dashboarding in tableau
